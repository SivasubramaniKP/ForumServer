        "ans":"I'm currently working on a similar thing. First of all, roughness is not an absolute unit as it depends on the object to be analyzed (the smooth or rough one) and the object that intercalates on that surface. In a macro and super-simple approach we could use friction as a measure of roughness. Moving to a medium scale we can thing on a surface of a material with peaks and valleys, in that case you can measure the frequencie and the absolute depth of those peaks (statistics). But I think that you want something even more little, that is my field. In that case usually depends on what do you want to intercalate in that surface, for different elements or molecules you can assume a surface as smooth as it can not be adsorbed easily in the surface.",
